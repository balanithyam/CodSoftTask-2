# Movie Rating Prediction #

📘 Project Overview
-This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie using features such as genre, director, actor, runtime, year, votes, and gross revenue.
It uses regression techniques to forecast ratings based on historical data.

Dataset Used: IMDb Movies India.csv
Total Records: [insert total records, e.g., 5000 movies]
Objective: Analyze movie data and predict ratings accurately.
Model Used: RandomForestRegressor

Final Model Performance:
  - R² Score: [insert value]
  - MAE: [insert value]
  - MSE: [insert value]

🔍 Key Insights
    Genres like [insert top genres, e.g., Action, Thriller] usually get higher ratings.
    Directors such as [insert names, e.g., Christopher Nolan] are linked to top-rated movies.
    Actors like [insert names, e.g., Leonardo DiCaprio] appear in highly rated films.
    There is a [positive/negative] correlation between votes and ratings.
    Runtime shows a [slight trend/no clear trend] with ratings.
    Movies with high gross revenue often get good ratings but not always.

🧩 Analysis Approach

- Data Loading:
  Loaded the movie dataset and checked the data.
- Data Cleaning:
  Removed missing and duplicate values. Kept only needed columns.
- Feature Creation:
  Split genres, changed director and actor names into numbers, and used numeric columns like       votes, year, and runtime.
- Visualization:
  Made charts to see trends between ratings, genres, and votes.
- Model Building:
  Used RandomForestRegressor to train the model for predicting ratings.
- Model Testing:
  Checked accuracy using R², MAE, and MSE values.
- Prediction:
  Created a small tool to predict movie ratings for new data.

💼 Business Insights
  - Focus more on genres that usually get high ratings.
  - Work with top-rated directors and actors for better results.
  - Encourage audience votes to improve visibility and engagement.
  - Analyze runtime to find the best length for each genre.

🛠 Technologies Used
  - Language: Python
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📊 Output Summary
    - The model got an R² score of [insert value], showing [good/moderate] prediction accuracy.
    - The MAE of [insert value] means the model’s average error is around that much rating points.
    - Top important features include [insert top 2-3, e.g., Genre_Action, Votes, Director].

🔮 Future Enhancements
    - Tune the model to improve accuracy.
    - Try ensemble methods for better results.
    - Use advanced text features for names.
    - Test neural networks for complex patterns.
    - Deploy as a web or API app for real-time use.

🏁 Conclusion
This project predicts movie ratings using machine learning.
It shows that genre, director, actor, and votes influence movie success.
The RandomForestRegressor model gives good results and can be improved for real-world use.
